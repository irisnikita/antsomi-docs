**@antscorp/antsomi-locales** is designed to simplify the process of translating your application's user
interface by utilizing **i18n** behind the scenes, all while being bundled with TypeScript. The primary
goal is to eliminate the complexity of managing providers and repetitive boilerplate code, ensuring a
seamless integration of multilingual support into your project. With this library, developers can focus
on delivering content in multiple languages without worrying about the underlying infrastructure..

It is compatible with both React and non-React projects, as it doesn't rely on any providers.

**Note**: Translation data is auto-generated from the **BA** document. **Do not manually edit the JSON files inside the package**.
